    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <li>
        When augmented reality is used with a newspaper, a photo in an article is scanned with the camera of a mobile device.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
        The AR software identifies the photo and then loads related digital content. The content is displayed in the device's camera view.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        It's often positioned over the scanned photo so that the digital content appears to have replaced the photo.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        A photo gallery, the latest news updates or sport scores, related social media information, educational animations, additional facts, a relevant map, a restaurant menu, a competition entry, or a reservation page for a special event are all possible uses for newspaper AR.
    </li>
